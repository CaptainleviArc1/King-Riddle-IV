    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>King Riddle IV, known in everyday life as Elorm, is a 13-year-old student at Trinity Academy, standing firmly in Dome Pillar 2—a place that quietly shaped his mindset long before he realized it. While many see him as just another student navigating school life, those who pay attention notice something different: a mind that never rests, a presence that feels intentional, and a personality forged through reflection, pressure, and growth.</p>
    <p>Elorm is widely recognized as smart and intelligent, but intelligence alone does not define him. What sets him apart is the way he thinks deeply, sometimes too deeply. He is an overthinker by nature—someone who doesn’t simply experience moments but dissects them, replays them, and searches for meaning beneath the surface. This trait, while often exhausting, became the foundation of his character development.</p>
    <p>From an early stage, competition became part of his identity. Not always outward, not always loud—but internal. He competes with expectations, with doubt, and most of all with his past self. Whether in academics, gaming, or social situations, he feels a quiet urge to prove that he is capable of more than what is immediately visible. This competitive edge isn’t about dominance; it’s about self-validation—the need to know that his effort means something.</p>
    <p>Yet, despite his intelligence and drive, Elorm’s journey has not been smooth. One of the most defining struggles in his life has been social anxiety. In social settings, especially unfamiliar ones, his mind races ahead of his body. He thinks about what to say, how it will sound, how it will be received, and what could go wrong—all before the first word even leaves his mouth.</p>
    <p>Elorm is social by nature—curious, observant, and capable of connection. What holds him back is not a lack of interest, but a surplus of awareness. He notices tone changes, pauses, reactions. He feels things deeply, and that depth makes him cautious. This is the character development arc—the phase where pain turns into wisdom, anxiety into awareness, and potential starts to crystallize into identity. King Riddle IV is defined by adaptation, reflection, and the quiet decision to improve even when no one is watching. This is only the beginning.</p>
